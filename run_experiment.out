Training: Agent sees all property counts during training
Evaluation: Agent tested separately on each property count

5        0.54         0.00         0.00        

Overall training mean (last 100 eps): 0.53

Correlation between property count and eval return: 0.451
RESULT: No negative correlation observed.
  Agent generalizes well across property counts.
